# Interacting with Web Sites using TypeScript

One of the reasons we are learning TypeScript specifically is it interacts very well with web sites.

In this lesson, we will explore the very basics of how that interaction might work, as well as get a glimpse at what web pages look like in their code. This should be helpful for many of your IAs.

## Getting your Code

If you are seeing this, you already clicked the link and have your own version of the code. For this assignment (and, I think, most assignments from now on) I will provide you with TWO options for editing your code.

### Option 1 - GitHub Desktop and VS Code (the old way)

- [ ] Open GitHub Desktop
- [ ] Choose "File->Clone from Internet"
- [ ] Find this repository and clone it to your computer
- [ ] Open in VS Code by clicking the button.

### Option 2 - GitPod (the new way)
- [ ] Copy the URL for this github page (in your address bar)
- [ ] Make a new tab. Type "gitpod.io/#" then paste the copied URL AFTER the # sign.

If you use the GitPod method, you may have to sign in with your GitHub account and give it permission to access things. Go ahead and do it. Once it's done, you'll get a special version of VS code that runs DIRECTLY IN YOUR WEB BROWSER. A few things are different, but many things are the same.

It's up to you which you use. I still plan to mostly use VS Code. But GitPod is very neat and allows you to work on any computer (and resume your work) without needing to sync code manually - it's all in the cloud.

## Doing your Assignment

Instructions for this assignment are in the file `interact.ts`. Start there.

## Handing in your assignment

In VS Code or GitPod, click the icon on the left that says "Source Control" when you hover over it. Then click the little "+" button next to any files you changed in that list. Type a message like "handing in" and click the check mark to commit. Finally, click the three dots and choose "push" to upload your change. If using gitpod, you may have to give it permission to do things.
