# Interacting with Web Sites using TypeScript

One of the reasons we are learning TypeScript specifically is it interacts very well with web sites.

In this lesson, we will explore the very basics of how that interaction might work, as well as get a glimpse at what web pages look like in their code. This should be helpful for many of your IAs.
