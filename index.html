<!--
    HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language". It is used
    to define the STRUCTURE of a web page (but not how it looks
    or behaves).

    Comments in HTML start with the <!-- thing you see above
    (we call this a *tag*) and end with the one down below. 

    The first line below simply tells our web browser this is an HTML file.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--
    In HTML, you use OPENING and CLOSING tags to surround *regions* of your page.
    The <html> is an opening tag. At the very bottom, you'll see it's closing tag, </html>
    These surround the entire page.

    The <head> and </head> tags surround *header information*. This includes the title (which appears
    in the tab name for a site) and any *metadata* that doesn't define the structure of the page itself
    - including links to other files that are important. Our header links to a javascript file (for interactivity)
    and a CSS file (which defines the look of the page)
-->
<html>
  <head>
    <title>
      My First TypeScript Page
    </title>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="interact.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>
  <!--
      The visible part of the page is all contained between <body> and </ body>. If you have a header or footer
      you can have <header></header> tags at the beginning of the body and <footer></footer> at the end, but our
      page doesn't have those, so we put <main></main> tags just inside the body to hold our page.
  -->
  <body>
    <main>
      <!--
          <h1> and </h1> tags sourround Headings. h1 is the most important, down to h6 the least important. 
          Since this h1 at the top is our title (h1 usually is), we give it the special id 'title'. Any region
          can be given an id in this way, but each id can only appear once.
      -->
      <h1 id="title">
        My First TypeScript Page
      </h1>
      <h2>Input Area</h2>
      <!--
          A 'div' is a generic structure that lets you group elements together with a name. Our website has an
          input area and an output area, so we made two divs. I put the headers outside the divs, but I could
          have done it the other way.

          For now, don't worry about the inputs or buttons - you'll see them when we run the page.
      -->
      <div id="input_area">
        <p>
          <label for="input_text">Type a word: </label>
          <input type="text" id="input_text" />
        </p>
        <p>
          <button id="interact_button" onclick="interact()">
            Interact!
          </button>
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Output Area</h2>
      <!--
          Right now our output area is blank. We'll use the typescript to fill it!
      -->
      <div id="output_area"></div>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
