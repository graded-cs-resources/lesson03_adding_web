<!--
    HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language". It is used
    to define the STRUCTURE of a web page (but not how it looks
    or behaves).

    Comments in HTML start with the <!-- thing you see above
    (we call this a *tag*) and end with the one down below. 

    The first line below simply tells our web browser this is an HTML file.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--
    In HTML, you use OPENING and CLOSING tags to surround *elements* of your page.
    The <html> is an opening tag. At the very bottom, you'll see it's closing tag, </html>
    These surround the entire page.
-->
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- This is the 'heading' regin. Most things here are invisible to the user. The title gives the tab name.-->
    <title>
      My Simple Chatbot
    </title>
    <!-- these next two lines load in our other files. One is the javascript, one is the styling.-->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="chat.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- The visible part of the page is all contained between <body> and </ body>.-->
    <!-- Since we don't have a header or footer, we create a "main" section right away. -->
    <main>
      <!-- <h1> and </h1> surround large headings. This particular h1 is our title, thus the id.-->
      <h1 id="title">
        My Simple Chatbot ðŸ¤–
      </h1>
      <!-- <h2> amd </h2> surround smaller headings. These can go down to h6 -->
      <h2>Input Area</h2>
      <!-- "divs" are generic structures to break your page into different parts.-->
      <div id="input_area">
        <!-- <p> and </p> tags surround paragraphs. We are breaking this into two paragraphs.-->
        <p>
          <!-- these next two set up a text input box and a label for it-->
          <label for="input_text">Talk to me! </label>
          <input type="text" id="input_text" />
        </p>
        <p>
          <button id="chat_button" onclick="chat()">
            Submit
          </button>
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Output Area</h2>
      <!--
          Right now our output area is blank. We'll use the typescript to fill it!
      -->
      <div id="output_area"></div>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
